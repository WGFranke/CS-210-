1) For this project I created a program that shows the power of investing and compund interest. This program asks for someone's
   initial investment amopunt, mopnthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years. Once the user inputs this data they will
   receive 2 reports. One being year-end-balance with no additional monthly deposits and the other year-end-balance based on the
   monthly deposit value. This program helps people know where there mopney is going when investing.

2) In this project I felt I added in line commecnts really well. The first projecty I submitted I did not have in line comments.
   I did see the reason for them besides it was a best practice. When adding them in this code it helped me immensly. It helped
   me stay organzied, and when others look at the code it will help them better understand my code.

3) I feel like I should have put variables into a header sheet to clean up the cpp file.
   
4) In displayMonthlyReportTable I had a hard time lining up the data correctly. When I was struggling I just went and kept
   changing small parts of the code and then de bugged to see what it was exactly changing. I did this for multiple parts of
   the table and it helped me undersatnd ever line of code and how it affected the table.

5) Creating the tables for this project gave me a new skill. Making tables was sometrhing I have never done before and was a
   big challange for me. Going forward in other classes I am sure that I will have to make more tables. This project will help
   me in the future when creating more.

6) In line comments I made helped my code be readable maintainable and adaptable.
